searching algorithm 
- I had chosen DFS implemention and used c++ to write my code.
- My visual studio is not working very well so i ran my progam online on some open source website onlineGDB.com, you just go their and run but if you are uisng visual studio then go to menubar->deburg->start without deburging. It will compile the program if their are no errors then menubar->built->built project.
- Their is an attached cpp file of my program and a mp4 video that it is running perfectly.
